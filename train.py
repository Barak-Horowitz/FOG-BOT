# train.py is the main file to train the model

 Some stuff from Gemini to get started:

# Python
# initialize DQN network (Q) and target network (Q_target)
# initialize experience replay memory
# initialize belief state

# for episode in range(num_episodes):
#     reset environment and get initial observation
#     update belief state

#     for step in range(max_steps_per_episode):
#         # Epsilon-Greedy action selection
#         if random.random() < epsilon: 
#             action = random.choice(available_actions)
#         else:
#             action = argmax_a Q(observation, belief_state)

#         # Execute action, receive reward and next observation
#         next_observation, reward, done, _ = environment.step(action) 

#         # Update belief state
#         next_belief_state = update_belief(next_observation, belief_state)

#         # Store experience 
#         memory.store((observation, belief_state, action, reward, next_observation, next_belief_state, done))

#         observation = next_observation
#         belief_state = next_belief_state

#         # Sample a mini-batch from memory
#         batch = memory.sample(batch_size)

#         # Calculate target Q-values (using the target network)
#         target_q_values = calculate_target_q_values(batch, Q_target)

#         # Train the DQN network on the mini-batch with target_q_values
#         Q.train_on_batch(batch, target_q_values)

#         # Update parameters of target network
#         if step % target_update_freq == 0:
#             Q_target.set_weights(Q.get_weights())

#     # Decay epsilon for exploration
#     epsilon = update_epsilon(epsilon)
# Use code with caution.
# Important Notes:

# Hyperparameters: num_episodes, max_steps_per_episode, epsilon, target_update_freq, and your DQN architecture will require tuning.
# calculate_target_q_values: This function will need to utilize the target network to compute TD targets (Q-values based on the next state).
# update_epsilon: Handles exploration vs. exploitation decay.
# Complexity: Imperfect information game mechanics and belief state representation are the major drivers of complexity.
